## Introduction

Disabled people in developing countries such as Mexico are one of the most outcasted minorities in terms of development and accessibility issues. Recently, in Mexico, the results from the Census of Population and Housing of 2020 carried out by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI for its acronym in Spanish) were made publicly available. This new information allows the development of up-to-date analyses of the development disparities between disabled individuals and the rest of the population in the specific context of the state of Yucatan. The results of our analysis found out that, for better or worse, city blocks with high density of disabled people are more equally distributed compared to low density city blocks. Moreover, we discovered that in general, high density blocks are well distributed across the state. The outcome of our analysis seeks to raise awareness and shed some light on the lacking of public policies aimed at helping disabled people.
